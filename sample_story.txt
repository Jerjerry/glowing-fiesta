The Little Red Bird

Once upon a time, there was a small red bird who loved to sing. Every morning, she would perch on the highest branch of the old oak tree and greet the sun with her beautiful melody.

"What a wonderful voice you have!" said the wise old owl one night.
"Thank you," chirped the little red bird shyly. "I just love to sing!"

One day, a great storm came to the forest. The wind howled and the trees swayed, but the little red bird kept singing. Her sweet song gave courage to all the forest animals, helping them stay calm through the storm.

From that day on, she became known as the Heart of the Forest, and her songs brought joy to all who heard them.
